The number of possible arrangements of nucleotides along the DNA chain is immense. Usually two DNA strands are linked together in parallel by specific base-pairing and are helically coiled. Replication of DNA molecules is accomplished by separation of the two strands, followed by the building up of matching strands by means of base-pairing, using the two halves as templates. By a mechanism involving RNA, the structure of DNA is translated into the structure of proteins during their synthesis from amino acids.\\n(Source: ALL)"], "extremely": ["To an extreme degree."], "reality": ["Interaction between entities in the material world measured by time space stardards.", "An actual condition or circumstance."], "every": ["Every individual or anything of the given class, with no exceptions.", "All of a countable group, without exception."], "niobium": ["Chemical element with symbol Nb and atomic number 41, shiny grey transition metal."], "earn": ["To gain (success) through applied effort or work.", "To earn, to gain (money)."], "make": ["To allow urine to flow from the bladder out of the body.", "To excrete feces from one's body through the anus.", "To create something by combining or assembling materials or parts or by changing it.", "To cause someone to do something.", "To cause to be or become.", "To be the material or components of.", "To be the cause of.", "To calculate roughly, often from imperfect data.", "To be or constitute a general essence of, to be in the broadest sense identified with or part of, to often come with, to make something or someone special.", "(Of God, also of Nature personified) To bring into existence (a material or spiritual object).", "(in passive form) To be naturally fitted or destined.", "To put materials together for (a fire) and light it.", "To produce the material or physical existence of by some action.", "To give certain properties to someone or something.", "To come to the sum of; to add up to.", "(Of a person) To become by development or training; to favor the development of.", "To make official a document, law, rule, rate, etc.", "To write out (a legal document, especially one's will) in due form.", "To prepare (an article of food or drink) for consumption.", "To perform or carry out (e.g. a bodily movement or a decision).", "To enter into or conclude a legal agreement.", "To deliver (a lecture, a sermon, etc.) orally.", "[With verbal nouns, forming phrases approximately equivalent to the source verb]", "To eat (a meal).", "To incur (a loss, an expense, etc.).", "To accomplish (a distance, or speed) by travelling, using a vehicle, etc.", "To reach (a place) in travelling.", "To achieve (a point, a goal, an honor, etc.).", "To recognize (a person, etc.).", "To induce (a person) to consent to sexual relation.", "To achieve a place in (a list).", "To receive prominent attention in (the news, etc.)", "(Of a river, road, etc.:) to undergo (a turn or bend) in its course.", "To prepare (a bed) for sleeping in.", "To attempt, offer, or start to do something.", "To proceed (in a direction).", "To enable somebody the holder of a title or member of a group .", "To earn, to gain (money).", "To be able to pay for (an expense).", "(Of the flood, or ebb tide, or wind) to be in progress.
